              This dashboard was happily hacked together by Colter and may have some bugs as he had a trek to go on.
            If left open, the dashboard should update itself with our approximate where-abouts every minute.  ü§ûthat it works.
            </p>
            <p>The vertical axis is Elevation in meters, the horizontal is distance in Km and the red lines are the approximate deliniation for each day.</p>
